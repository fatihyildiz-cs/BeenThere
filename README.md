# BeenThere

BeenThere is one of my former internship projects. It is essentially a social-media platform with detailed map interaction. 

Written in C#, this project gave me a good understanding of Object Oriented Programmming. MSSQL and Entity Framework Core is used to establish database access.

I used Bootstrap and some template HTML to build user interfaces.
